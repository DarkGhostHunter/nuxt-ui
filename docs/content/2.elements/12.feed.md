## Usage

Add an array of events in the `feed` prop.

::component-card
---
baseProps:
  feed:
    - Cloned
    - Installed
    - Configured
    - Deployed
---
::

You may also use an array of objects as a feed, with the following properties:

- `title` - The item title text
- `description` - The secondary line of text below the title
- `trailing` - The third line of text at the end of the item
- `color` - The color of the indicator
- `icon` - The icon to add as an indicator

:component-example{component="feed-example-objects"}

### Indicators

You can transform the indicators to a small dot for all the events by setting the `indicators` prop to `false`.

baseProps:
  feed:
    - title: Cloned
      description: Repository retrieved from GitHub
      icon: i-heroicons-cloud-arrow-down
      trailing: Oct 8 09:35:05
    - title: Installed
      description: Dependencies installed
      icon: i-heroicons-clipboard-document-check
      trailing: Oct 8 09:36:21
    - title: Configured
      description: App configuration applied
      icon: i-heroicons-wrench
      trailing: Oct 8 09:36:32
    - title: Deployed
      description: App running
      icon: i-heroicons-paper-airplane
      trailing: Oct 8 09:36:38
props:
  indicators: false
---
::

### Separators

You may disable the separators by setting `separators` to `false` 

::component-card
---
baseProps:
  feed:
    - Cloned
    - Installed
    - Configured
    - Deployed
props:
  separators: false
  indicators: false
---
::

### Style

Use the `color` prop to change the visual style of the indicators. If an event contains the `color` property, it will take precedence over the element prop.

## Slots

### `icon`

You have access to the item indicator through the `icon` prop, that receives the item and its index on the feed. You can use this to change how the indicator is shown on the feed for each item.

:component-example{component="feed-example-slot-icon"}

### `body`

You can change how the feed item contents is presented using the `body` prop. It receives the item and the index position.

:component-example{component="feed-example-slot-body"}

### `trailing`

You can change how the trailing text is presented using the `trailing` prop. It receives the item and the index position.

:component-example{component="feed-example-slot-trailing"}
